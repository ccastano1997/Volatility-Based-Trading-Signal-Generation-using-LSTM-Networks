# LSTM-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategy for SPY üìà

## üìñ About The Project

This project explores the application of deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for predicting the daily price movement of the SPY ETF (an ETF that tracks the S&P 500). The model's predictions are then used to generate trading signals for a simple long-only strategy.

The primary goal was to develop an end-to-end quantitative trading workflow, from data acquisition and feature engineering to model training and performance backtesting. The final strategy was benchmarked against a traditional "Buy and Hold" approach.

### Key Features
* **Data Acquisition:** Fetches historical daily market data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creates a rich feature set using technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
* **Deep Learning Model:** Implements a Bidirectional LSTM network in TensorFlow/Keras to capture temporal patterns.
* **Backtesting:** Includes a simple backtesting engine to evaluate strategy performance on out-of-sample data.
* **Performance Visualization:** Generates clear visualizations of the strategy's equity curve against the benchmark.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

The entire workflow is contained within the Jupyter Notebook (`trading_strategy.ipynb`).

1.  Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom to execute the data preparation, model training, and backtesting process.

## üìä Results

The model was trained on data from 2010 to late 2021 and tested on unseen data from late 2021 to mid-2024.

### Strategy Performance vs. Buy and Hold

The backtest results show that the LSTM-based strategy **successfully outperformed the SPY buy-and-hold benchmark** over the test period. The strategy was able to capture market gains while better navigating periods of high volatility and drawdowns.

### Model Training History

Interestingly, while the final strategy was profitable, the model's validation accuracy remained relatively low (around 58%). This highlights a key concept in algorithmic trading: a model doesn't need to be perfect to have a profitable edge.
